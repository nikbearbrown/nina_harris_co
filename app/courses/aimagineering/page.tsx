              <p>
                Standard Design Thinking runs five stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test. AIMagineering adds a sixth — Commit — because the decision to ship, to stand behind a design, to accept responsibility for its consequences, is where human judgment becomes non-negotiable.
              </p>

              <p>
                AI can assist in every stage of the pipeline. It can synthesize user research, generate variations, build prototypes, and even simulate test scenarios. But it cannot commit. Commitment requires ownership, accountability, and the willingness to be wrong — capacities that have no equivalent in a generative model.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Empathize — understand the problem from inside the user&apos;s experience</li>
                <li>Define — frame the problem in terms that make it solvable</li>
                <li>Ideate — generate possibilities without premature evaluation</li>
                <li>Prototype — make ideas concrete enough to test</li>
                <li>Test — expose the prototype to reality and learn from the collision</li>
                <li>Commit — decide, ship, and take responsibility for the outcome</li>
              </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Commit Stage</h2>
            <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
              <p>
                Design Thinking typically ends at Test. The assumption is that iteration continues indefinitely — you test, learn, and loop back. But real design requires a moment of commitment: this is what we&apos;re building. This is what we stand behind.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Commit stage is where creative intelligence becomes irreducibly human. It requires integrating aesthetic judgment, ethical consideration, practical constraint, and personal conviction into a single decision. No model can do this, because no model has stakes.
              </p>

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Generative AI excels at novelty — producing outputs that are statistically unlikely given the training data. Originality requires something more: a perspective, a reason, a point of view that the work embodies. Students learn to distinguish between the two.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Human creativity often works by combining concepts from different domains in ways that create new meaning. This is not the same as interpolation. Students practice conceptual blending as a deliberate creative method.
