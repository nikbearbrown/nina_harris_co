                Ethical Play treats moral frameworks — deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics, care ethics — not as competing doctrines but as game mechanics. Each framework defines a different set of rules for navigating a moral situation. Students learn to play within each framework fluently before stepping back to ask which game they should be playing.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is the core pedagogical move: ethical reasoning is not about choosing the right framework and applying it. It&apos;s about developing the judgment to know which considerations matter most in a given context, and being honest about the tradeoffs.

                <li>Deontological constraints as hard rules — what you must never do</li>
                <li>Consequentialist calculation as optimization — what produces the best outcome</li>
                <li>Virtue ethics as character formation — what kind of person this decision makes you</li>
                <li>Care ethics as relational attention — who is affected and how</li>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The AI Ethical Auditor Session</h2>
            <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
              <p>
                The centerpiece of the course is the AI Ethical Auditor session. Students present an AI system — real or hypothetical — and submit it to structured ethical audit. The auditor applies each framework in turn, identifies conflicts, and produces a judgment.
              </p>

              <p>
                The critical insight emerges in the debrief: AI can perform the structural analysis. It can identify stakeholders, enumerate consequences, flag rule violations. What it cannot do is feel the moral weight of a decision. The gap between &quot;this analysis identifies a harm&quot; and &quot;this matters&quot; is irreducibly human.
              </p>

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    AI can enumerate stakeholders, map consequences, and flag inconsistencies with stated principles. This is useful. But it is the beginning of moral reasoning, not the end.
                  </p>

                    The experience of a decision mattering — of stakes being real, of consequences falling on actual people — is what converts analysis into judgment. This is what makes ethical reasoning irreducibly human.
