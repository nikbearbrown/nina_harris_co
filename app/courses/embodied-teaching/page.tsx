            Teaching is irreducibly human. This course covers presence, improvisation, emotional attunement, and the embodied skills that make mentorship effective — none of which transfer to a language model. Students develop AI integration plans for domains where learning happens in the body.

              <p>
                Not every teaching task should be handed to AI, and not every task needs to be protected from it. The central framework of this course is the handoff vs. protect distinction: a systematic method for deciding which parts of a teaching practice can be delegated to AI tools and which must remain in human hands.
              </p>

              <p>
                Handoff candidates are tasks where AI can perform adequately and where the human element does not meaningfully change the outcome — grading multiple-choice exams, generating practice problems, summarizing readings. Protect candidates are tasks where the human presence is the pedagogy — reading a room, adjusting pace in real time, responding to a student&apos;s confusion with the right question at the right moment.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Handoff: administrative, repetitive, and content-delivery tasks</li>
                <li>Protect: relational, improvisational, and presence-dependent tasks</li>
                <li>Gray zone: tasks that seem delegable but lose critical value when automated</li>
                <li>The integration plan: a structured document mapping each task to handoff or protect</li>
              </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Learning in the Body</h2>
            <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
              <p>
                Some domains teach through the body: music, athletics, surgery, dance, martial arts, physical therapy. In these fields, the mentor&apos;s physical presence, demonstration, and real-time adjustment are not supplementary — they are the primary medium of instruction.
              </p>

              <p>
                This course operates at Tier 2 depth because the skills it addresses are among the most obviously irreducible. No AI system can physically demonstrate a technique, feel a student&apos;s tension, or adjust a hand position. The pedagogical challenge is not whether AI can replace embodied teaching — it clearly cannot — but how to integrate AI tools without eroding the embodied core.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    A teacher&apos;s physical and emotional presence shapes the learning environment in ways that cannot be replicated through a screen, let alone a text interface. Students examine what &quot;presence&quot; means operationally and why it matters pedagogically.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Effective teaching is improvisational. The plan is a starting point, but the real teaching happens in response to what the students actually do. AI cannot improvise in this sense because it cannot read the room.
