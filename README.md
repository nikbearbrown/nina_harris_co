### System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- RAM: At least 4GB recommended
- Disk Space: At least 1GB free space
- Internet connection for downloading packages

### Installation by Operating System

#### Windows
1. Download and run the Node.js installer from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download and run the Git installer from [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Restart your computer after installation

### Verifying Installation
After installation, verify that everything is set up correctly:

npm --version
git --version
```

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation:

1. **npm install fails**
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Try using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag if there are dependency conflicts
   - Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version

2. **Permission errors**
   - Windows: Run terminal as administrator
   - Mac/Linux: Use `sudo` for system-wide installations

3. **Network issues**
   - Check your internet connection
   - If behind a proxy, configure npm accordingly
   - Try using a different npm registry: `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`
